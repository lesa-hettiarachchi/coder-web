# Docker Setup Verification Guide

## âœ… Quick Verification Steps

### 1. **Check Docker is Running**
```bash
docker --version
docker ps
```
Should show Docker version and running containers (or empty list).

### 2. **Validate Configuration**
```bash
docker-compose config
```
Should show valid YAML without errors.

### 3. **Build Image**
```bash
docker build -t escape-room-test .
```
Should complete successfully without errors.

### 4. **Start Services**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Should start all services (app, database, redis).

### 5. **Check Service Health**
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
Should show all services as "Up" or "healthy".

### 6. **Test Application**
- Visit: http://localhost:3000
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/escape-rooms
- Should load without errors

### 7. **Check Logs**
```bash
docker-compose logs app
docker-compose logs database
```
Should show no critical errors.

### 8. **Stop Services**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Docker daemon not running**
   - Start Docker Desktop
   - Wait for it to fully start

2. **Port conflicts**
   - Check if ports 3000, 5432, 6379 are free
   - Kill processes using these ports

3. **Database connection issues**
   - Wait longer for database to initialize
   - Check database logs: `docker-compose logs database`

4. **Build failures**
   - Check Dockerfile syntax
   - Ensure all files are present
   - Check for memory issues

## ðŸ“Š Verification Checklist

- [ ] Docker daemon running
- [ ] Docker Compose config valid
- [ ] Image builds successfully
- [ ] Services start without errors
- [ ] Database is healthy
- [ ] Application accessible at localhost:3000
- [ ] Escape room page loads
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Services can be stopped cleanly

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

When everything works correctly:
- All 3 services (app, database, redis) should be running
- Application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000
- Escape room game should be playable
- No error messages in logs
- Clean shutdown when stopping services

## ðŸš€ Production Readiness

Your Docker setup includes:
- âœ… Multi-stage build for optimization
- âœ… Non-root user for security
- âœ… Health checks for database
- âœ… Proper environment variables
- âœ… Volume mounts for data persistence
- âœ… Network isolation between services
- âœ… Production-ready PostgreSQL setup
